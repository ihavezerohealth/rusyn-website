## How do I contribute content?
I'm glad that you want to contribute! In order to do so, please make sure to check that your lesson is correct and of good quality,
and then please send it to `ihavezerohealth#5451` on Discord for review and upload!
#### Note: eventually it will be possible to upload lessons to the website directly


## How do I contribute code?
If you're someone who knows their way around Vuetify or VueJS, a code contribution is always welcome. Please open a pull request first
to check that it is something necessary, and then please send another when you're finished with your contribution. Thank you!

## When will you get hosting?
"I don't know" is the most honest answer here. Right now, hosting is going to be difficult for me to set up, but I am working towards getting myself a device or setting up my old computer so that it can host this website 24/7, because I _do_ believe that it could be a good resource.
